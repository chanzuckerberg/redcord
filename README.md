YARR - Yet Another Redis Record
-------------------------------
Redis Record provides an object-relational mapping like Active Record, but for Redis.

**Note:** This is a pre-release version.

## Getting Started
### 1. Add yarr to your Gemfile
```ruby
# -- Gemfile --

gem 'yarr'
```

### 2. Connect to a Redis server
### TODO: `config/redisrecord.yml` -> `config/redis_record.yml`
In `config/redis_record.yml`, set a default Redis URL for all Redis Record models in the test and development environment. **Note:** the local Redis server version needs to be >= 4.x.
```ruby
development:
  default:
    url: redis://127.0.0.1:6379/1

test:
  default:
    url: redis://127.0.0.1:6379/2
```

### 3. Create a Redis Record model
In the example, we create a UserSession model -- The in-memory Redis database is great for session management.
```ruby
class UserSession < T::Struct
  include RedisRecord::Base

  ttl 2.hours

  attribute :user_id, Integer, index: true
  attribute :session_id, String
end
```

### 4. Reading and writing data
#### Read
Return the first user session that matches the user's id:
```ruby
UserSession.find_by(user_id: user.id) # TODO: support this
```
**Note:** This query wonâ€™t work until we execute a Redis Record migration for adding the index.

Like Active Record, created_at and updated_at are maintained automatically on each record. Find all user sessions created an hour ago:
```ruby
UserSession.where('created_at < ?',  Time.zone.now - 1.hour) # TODO: support this
```

#### Update
Once a Redis Record object has been retrieved, its attributes can be modified and it can be saved to the Redis database.
```ruby
user_session = UserSession.find_by(user_id: user.id)
user_session.updated_at = Time.zone.now
user_session.save # TODO: support this
```

A shorthand for this is to use a hash mapping attribute names to the desired value:
```ruby
user_session.update(updated_at: Time.zone.now) # TODO: support this
```

#### Delete
Once a Redis Record object has been retrieved, it can be destroyed which removes it from the database.
```ruby
user_session = UserSession.find_by(user_id: user.id)
user_session.destroy
```

### 5. Migrations
Redis Record provides a domain-specific language for updating model schemas on Redis called migrations. Migrations are stored in files which are executed against each Redis database used in the current Rails environment.

Here's a migration that adds an index on user_id and adds a TTL on each user session:
### TODO: db/redisrecord -> db/redis_record 
`db/redis_record/migrate/20200504000000_create_user_session.rb`:
```ruby
class CreateUserSession < RedisRecord::Migration
  def up
    change_ttl_passive(UserSession)
    add_index(UserSession, :user_id)
  end

  def down
    change_ttl_passive(UserSession, nil)
    remove_index(UserSession, :user_id)
  end
end
```

Use the following rake command to run this migration
```bash
$ rake redis:migrate
redis                           direction                       version                         migration                       duration
redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0        UP                              20200504000000                  Create user session           18.03934400959406 ms

## Related Projects; Yet Another Redis Record
To the best of our knowledge, YARR is the best Ruby ORM lib for Redis.

### https://github.com/soveran/ohm
This project is inspired by ohm. YARR has the following features which Ohm does not have:
- An Active Record like API
- Range index queries support
- Atomic CRUD operations
- Runtime and statical type-checking (with sorbet)
- One Redis DB roundtrip per operation
- Migrations and push safety protection

### https://github.com/nateware/redis-objects
Redis object map Redis types directly to Ruby objects, but it does not provide an object-relational mapping.

### https://redisql.com/
- RediSQL is not ORM
- RediSQL does not support indexing
- RediSQL uses a Redis server extension, which is not supported by all Redis PaaSs. Redis Record uses Lua scripts that are generally supported.

### Abandoned projects:
- https://github.com/malditogeek/redisrecord/
- https://github.com/LoonyBin/redis_record
- https://rubygems.org/gems/redis_record

## Performance
Redis Record is fast!

### TODO: Comparison with Postgres
### TODO: Benchmark results

## Fault tolerance
We recommend using Redis Record on a Redis PaaS which has built-in failover support. If a Redis server is down, there will be downtime, but the Redis Platform would hopefully recover quickly.

**Note:**
- Set the Redis server to noevict
- (optional) Take screenshots of the server regularly
- Do not use Redis Cluster
- Rely on fail-over instead of AOF persistency
